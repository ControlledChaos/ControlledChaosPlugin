# Controlled Chaos

An object-oriented WordPress starter plugin for building custom-tailored websites. This is a tool, a means to an end. But it can be used as is without further development.

## Dependencies

I can't say precicely but I will say this:

* This plugin was written in a WordPress 4.9+ environment with no concern for backwards compatitbility.
* This plugin was written on a local server running PHP 7.0
* The short array syntax ( "[]" rather than "array()" ) requires PHP 5.4+
* Run a modern system and you'll be fine.

To take advantage of all of its features, this plugin is recommended for use with Advanced Custom Fields PRO or the free version of ACF plus the Options Page addon.
